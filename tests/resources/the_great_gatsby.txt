'''''The Great Gatsby''''' is a [[1925 in literature|1925 novel]] written by American author [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous [[Long Island]] in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire [[Jay Gatsby]] and his quixotic passion and [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]] for the beautiful former [[debutante]] Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's [[magnum opus]], ''The Great Gatsby'' explores themes of [[decadence]], [[idealism]], resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the [[Jazz Age]] or the [[Roaring Twenties]] that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the [[American Dream]].<ref name=karolides2011>{{cite book |last1=Karolides |first1=Nicholas J. |last2=Bald |first2=Margaret |last3=Sova |first3=Dawn B. |title=120 Banned Books: Censorship Histories of World Literature |edition=Second |year=2011 |publisher=Checkmark Books |isbn=978-0-8160-8232-2 |page=499 |quote=Rather than a celebration of such decadence, the novel functions as a cautionary tale in which an unhappy fate is inevitable for the poor and striving individual, and the rich are allowed to continue without penalty their careless treatment of others' lives.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Hoover |first=Bob |title='The Great Gatsby' still challenges myth of American Dream |date=10 May 2013 |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/movies/great-gatsby-still-challenges-myth-of-american-dream-687050/ |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |accessdate=10 May 2013}}</ref>

Fitzgerald—inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island's north shore—began planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, "something ''new''—something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned."<ref>{{cite web |others=Images by Gareth M. |title=Something Extraordinary |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/01/something-extraordinary.html |work=Letters of Note |publisher=lettersofnote.com |accessdate=24 May 2013 |date=25 March 2013 }}</ref> Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the [[French Riviera]] in 1924. His editor, [[Maxwell Perkins]], felt the book was too vague and convinced the author to revise over the next winter. Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book's title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referenced the Roman character [[Trimalchio]]; the title he was last documented to have desired was ''Under the Red, White, and Blue''.

First published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]] in April 1925, ''The Great Gatsby'' received mixed reviews and sold poorly; in its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during [[World War II|World {{nowrap|War II}}]], and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades. Today, ''The Great Gatsby'' is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title "[[Great American Novel]]". In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] editorial board voted it the 20th century's best American novel and second best English-language novel of the same time period.<ref>{{cite web|title=100 Best Novels|url=http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/|publisher=Modern Library|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref>

==Historical context==
Set on the prosperous [[Long Island]] of 1922, ''The Great Gatsby'' provides a critical social history of America during the [[Roaring Twenties]] within its narrative. That era, known for unprecedented economic prosperity, the evolution of [[jazz music]], [[flapper]] culture, and [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] and other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses these societal developments of the 1920s to build Gatsby's stories from simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which was the source of Gatsby's fortune.<ref name="Bruccoli 2000 53–54">{{Harvnb|Bruccoli|2000|pp=53–54}}</ref> Fitzgerald educates his readers about the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing a timeless, relatable plotline within the historical context of the era.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gross |first=Dalton |title=Understanding the Great Gatsby: A Student Casebook to Issues, Sources, and Historical Documents |year=1998 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |page=167}}</ref>

Fitzgerald's visits to Long Island's north shore and his experience attending parties at mansions inspired ''The Great Gatsby'''s setting. Today, there are a number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book. One possibility is Land's End, a notable [[Gold Coast Mansions|Gold Coast Mansion]] where Fitzgerald may have attended a party.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kellogg|first=Carolyn|title=Last gasp of the Gatsby house|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2011/04/last-gasp-of-the-gatsby-house.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref> Many of the events in Fitzgerald's early life are reflected throughout ''The Great Gatsby''. Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick's case, Yale.) Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby, as he fell in love while stationed in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loves. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant, and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success.<ref name=sparknotes1>{{cite web |author=SparkNotes Editors |title=The Great Gatsby: Context |publisher=SparkNotes |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gatsby/context.html |accessdate=2013-11-25}}</ref> Like Nick in ''The Great Gatsby'', Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich.<ref name="sparknotes1"/> In many ways, ''The Great Gatsby'' represents Fitzgerald's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted, even as she led him toward everything he despised.<ref name="sparknotes1"/>

In her book ''Careless People: Murder, Mayhem and the Invention of 'The Great Gatsby''' (2013), [[Sarah Churchwell]] speculates that parts of the ending of ''The Great Gatsby'' (1925) by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] were based on the [[Hall–Mills murder case|Hall-Mills Case]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Powers, Thomas date=July 4, 2013| title=The Road to West Egg|work= London Review of Books|volume=13|pages= 9–11}}</ref> Based on her forensic search for clues, she asserts that the two victims in the Hall-Mills murder case inspired the characters who were murdered in ''The Great Gatsby''.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Leonard Lopate Show|author=Sarah Churchwell|title=''Murder, Mayhem, and the Invention of The Great Gatsby''|date=June 17, 2014|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/murder-mayhem-and-invention-great-gatsby/}}</ref>

==Plot summary==
The main events of the novel take place in the summer of 1922. Nick Carraway, a [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate and [[World War I|World {{nowrap|War I}}]] veteran from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]&nbsp;– who serves as the novel's narrator&nbsp;– takes a job in New York as a [[Bond (finance)|bond]] salesman. He rents a small house on [[Long Island]], in the (fictional) village of West Egg, next door to the lavish mansion of [[Jay Gatsby]], a mysterious millionaire who holds extravagant parties but does not participate in them. Nick drives around the bay to East Egg for dinner at the home of his cousin, Daisy Fay Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, a college acquaintance of Nick's. They introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, an attractive, cynical young golfer with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship. She reveals to Nick that Tom has a [[Extramarital affair|mistress]], Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the "[[Flushing Meadows–Corona Park|valley of ashes]]":<ref name="corona">{{cite web

Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle to an apartment they keep for their affair. At the apartment, a vulgar and bizarre party takes place. It ends with Tom breaking Myrtle's nose after she annoys him by saying Daisy's name several times.

[[File:Plaza Hotel NYC.jpg|thumb|The [[Plaza Hotel]] in the early 1920s]]
As the summer progresses, Nick eventually receives an invitation to one of Gatsby's parties. Nick encounters Jordan Baker at the party, and they meet Gatsby himself, an aloof and surprisingly young man who recognizes Nick from their same division in World War I. Through Jordan, Nick later learns that Gatsby knew Daisy from a romantic encounter in 1917 and is deeply in love with her. He spends many nights staring at the green light at the end of her dock, across the bay from his mansion, hoping to one day rekindle their lost romance. Gatsby's extravagant lifestyle and wild parties are an attempt to impress Daisy in the hope that she will one day appear again at Gatsby's doorstep. Gatsby now wants Nick to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy. Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house, without telling her that Gatsby will also be there. After an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy reestablish their connection. They begin an affair and, after a short time, Tom grows increasingly suspicious of his wife's relationship with Gatsby. At a luncheon at the Buchanans' house, Daisy speaks to Gatsby with such undisguised intimacy that Tom realizes she is in love with Gatsby. Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is outraged by his wife's infidelity. He forces the group to drive into New York City and confronts Gatsby in a suite at the [[Plaza Hotel]], asserting that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand. In addition to that, he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal whose fortune comes from [[Prohibition in the United States|bootlegging alcohol]] and other illegal activities. Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt him.

When Nick, Jordan, and Tom drive through the [[Flushing Meadows–Corona Park|valley of ashes]]<ref name="corona"/> on their way home, they discover that Gatsby's car has struck and killed Tom's mistress, Myrtle. Nick later learns from Gatsby that Daisy, not Gatsby himself, was driving the car at the time of the accident but Gatsby intends to take the blame anyway. Myrtle's husband, George, falsely concludes that the driver of the yellow car is the secret lover he recently began suspecting she has, and sets out on foot to locate its owner. After finding out the yellow car is Gatsby's, he arrives at Gatsby's mansion where he fatally shoots both Gatsby and then himself. Nick stages an unsettlingly small funeral for Gatsby, ends his relationship with Jordan, and moves back to the Midwest, disillusioned with the Eastern lifestyle.

==Major characters==
*<!--Please do not change to "Nicholas". See talk page discussion "Regarding 'Nicholas'" for details.-->'''Nick Carraway'''&nbsp;– a [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate originating from the Midwest, a World {{nowrap|War I}} veteran, and, at the start of the plot, a newly arrived resident of West Egg, who is aged 29 (later 30). He also serves as the [[first-person narrator]] of the novel. He is Gatsby's next-door neighbor and a bond salesman. He is easy-going, occasionally sarcastic, and somewhat optimistic, although this latter quality fades as the novel progresses.
*'''[[Jay Gatsby]]''' (originally '''James "Jimmy" Gatz''')&nbsp;– a young, mysterious millionaire with shady business connections (later revealed to be a [[Rum-running|bootlegger]]), originally from [[North Dakota]]. He is obsessed with Daisy Buchanan, a beautiful [[debutante]], from Louisville, Kentucky whom he had met when he was a young [[military officer]] stationed at the Army's Camp Taylor in Louisville during World {{nowrap|War I}}. Fitzgerald himself was actually based at Camp Taylor in Louisville when he was in the Army and makes various references to Louisville in the novel, including the Seelbach Hotel where the Buchanan party stayed while in town for Tom and Daisy's wedding. The character is based on the bootlegger and former World {{nowrap|War I}} officer Max Gerlach, according to ''Some Sort of Epic Grandeur,'' Matthew J. Bruccoli's biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Gatsby is said to have briefly studied at [[Trinity College, Oxford]] in [[England]] after the end of World {{nowrap|War I}}.<ref name=Oxford>{{cite book |last=McCullen |first=Bonnie Shannon |chapter=This Tremendous Detail: The Oxford Stone in the House of Gatsby |editor1-last=Assadi |editor1-first=Jamal |editor2-last=Freedman |editor2-first=William |publisher=New York: Peter Lang |year=2007 |title=A Distant Drummer: Foreign Perspectives on F. Scott Fitzgerald |isbn=978-0820488516}}</ref>
*'''Daisy Fay Buchanan'''&nbsp;– an attractive and effervescent, if shallow and self-absorbed, young Louisville, Kentucky [[debutante]] and [[socialite]], identified as a [[flapper]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Conor |first=Liz |title=The Spectacular Modern Woman: Feminine Visibility in the 1920s |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-21670-0 |page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=jWG2_Pt2Dw8C&pg=PA301 301] |url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=21644 |date=22 June 2004}}</ref> She is Nick's second [[cousin]], once removed; and the wife of Tom Buchanan. Daisy is believed to have been inspired by Fitzgerald's own youthful romances with [[Ginevra King]]. Daisy once had a romantic relationship with Gatsby, before she married Tom. Her choice between Gatsby and Tom is one of the central conflicts in the novel.
*'''Thomas "Tom" Buchanan'''&nbsp;– a millionaire who lives on East Egg, and Daisy's husband. Tom is an imposing man of muscular build with a "husky tenor" voice and arrogant demeanor. He is a former football star at [[Yale University|Yale]]. Buchanan has parallels with William Mitchell, the Chicagoan who married Ginevra King. Buchanan and Mitchell were both Chicagoans with an interest in [[polo]]. Like Ginevra's father, whom Fitzgerald resented, Buchanan attended [[Yale University|Yale]] and is a [[white supremacy|white supremacist]].<ref name=B911>{{Harvnb|Bruccoli|2000|pp=9–11}}</ref>
*'''Jordan Baker'''&nbsp;– Daisy Buchanan's long-time friend with "autumn-leaf yellow" hair, a firm athletic body, and an aloof attitude. She is Nick Carraway's girlfriend for most of the novel and an amateur golfer with a slightly shady reputation and a penchant for untruthfulness. Fitzgerald told Maxwell Perkins that Jordan was based on the golfer [[Edith Cummings]], a friend of Ginevra King.<ref name=B911/> Her name is a play on the two then-popular automobile brands, the [[Jordan Motor Car Company]] and the [[Baker Motor Vehicle]], alluding to Jordan's "fast" reputation and the freedom now presented to Americans, especially women, in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Bruccoli |editor-first=Matthew J. |editor-link=Matthew J.

*'''George B. Wilson'''&nbsp;– a mechanic and owner of a garage. He is disliked by both his wife, Myrtle Wilson, and Tom Buchanan, who describes him as "so dumb he doesn't know he's alive." When he learns of the death of his wife, he shoots and kills Gatsby, wrongly believing he had been driving the car that killed Myrtle, and then kills himself.
*'''Myrtle Wilson'''&nbsp;– George's wife, and Tom Buchanan's mistress. Myrtle, who possesses a fierce vitality, is desperate to find refuge from her complacent marriage, but unfortunately this leads to her tragic ending. She is accidentally killed by Gatsby's car (driven by Daisy, though Gatsby insists he would take the blame for the accident).

Wolfshiem appears only twice in the novel, the second time refusing to attend Gatsby's funeral. He is a clear [[allusion]] to [[Arnold Rothstein]], a New York crime kingpin who was notoriously blamed for the [[Black Sox Scandal]] which tainted the [[1919 World Series]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bruccoli|2000|p=29}}</ref>

Fitzgerald began planning his third novel in June 1922,<ref name="Bruccoli 2000 53–54"/> but it was interrupted by production of his play, ''[[The Vegetable, or From President to Postman|The Vegetable]]'', in the summer and fall.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gatsby, 35 Years Later |last=Mizener |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Mizener |date=24 April 1960 |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/12/24/specials/fitzgerald-gatsby60.html |accessdate=29 July 2013 |quote=He had begun to plan the novel in June, 1923, saying to Maxwell Perkins, 'I want to write something new&nbsp;— something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.'

After the birth of their child, the Fitzgeralds moved to [[Great Neck, New York]], on [[Long Island]], in October 1922; the town was used as the scene for ''The Great Gatsby''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Mary Jo |title=Eyeing the Unreal Estate of Gatsby Esq. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/nyregion/01gatsby.html?scp=58&sq=f%20scott%20fitzgerald&st=cse |work=The New York Times |date=30 September 2010}}</ref> Fitzgerald's neighbors in Great Neck included such prominent and newly wealthy New Yorkers as writer [[Ring Lardner]], actor [[Lew Fields]], and comedian [[Ed Wynn]].<ref name="Bruccoli 2000 53–54"/> These figures were all considered to be "[[nouveau riche|new money]]", unlike those who came from [[Manhasset Bay|Manhasset Neck]] or [[North Shore (Long Island)|Cow Neck Peninsula]], places which were home to many of New York's wealthiest established families, and which sat across a bay from Great Neck. This real-life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for "West Egg" and "East Egg". In this novel, Great Neck (King's Point) became the new-money peninsula of "West Egg" and Port Washington (Sands Point) the old-money "East Egg".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bruccoli|2000|pp=38–39}}</ref> Several mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby's home, such as [[Oheka Castle]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Bruccoli|2000|p=45}}</ref> and the now-demolished [[Beacon Towers]].<ref name=mansions>{{cite book |title=The Mansions of Long Island's Gold Coast |last=Randall |first=Mónica |year=2003 |publisher=Rizzoli |isbn=978-0-8478-2649-0 |pages=275–277}}</ref>

The cover of the first printing of ''The Great Gatsby'' is among the most celebrated pieces of art in American literature.<ref name=scribner>{{cite journal |last=Scribner |first=Charles, III |authorlink=Charles Scribner III |date=Winter 1992 |title=Celestial Eyes: From Metamorphosis to Masterpiece |journal=Princeton University Library Chronicle |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=140–155<!--The Chronicle index wrongly gives 141-156.--> |url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/pulc/pulc_v_53_n_2.pdf |accessdate=27 July 2013}} (originally published as a brochure on 24 October 1991 to celebrate the Cambridge Edition of ''The Great Gatsby'')</ref> It depicts disembodied eyes and a mouth over a blue skyline, with images of naked women reflected in the irises. A little-known artist named [[Francis Cugat]] was commissioned to illustrate the book while Fitzgerald was in the midst of writing it.<ref name=scribner/> The cover was completed before the novel; Fitzgerald was so enamored with it that he told his publisher he had "written it into" the novel.<ref name=scribner/> Fitzgerald's remarks about incorporating the painting into the novel led to the interpretation that the eyes are reminiscent of those of fictional optometrist Dr. T.

==Themes==
[[Sarah Churchwell]] sees ''The Great Gatsby'' as a "cautionary tale of the decadent downside of the American dream." The story deals with human aspiration to start over again, social politics and its brutality and also betrayal, of one's own ideals and of people. According to the story's narrator, Nick Carraway, "...a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth." <ref>Fitzgerald, F. Scott. ''The Great Gatsby''. New York: Scribner, 2004. Print.</ref> Using elements of irony and tragic ending, it also delves into themes of excesses of the rich, and recklessness of youth.<ref>{{cite news |last=Churchwell |first=Sarah |authorlink=Sarah Churchwell |title=What makes The Great Gatsby great? |date=3 May 2013 |work=The Guardian |url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/03/what-makes-great-gatsby?CMP=twt_gu&CMP=NECNETTXT766 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref><ref name=boston/>
Others, like journalist [[Nick Gillespie]], see ''The Great Gatsby'' as a story "about the breakdown of class differences in the face of a modern economy based not on status and inherited position but on innovation and an ability to meet ever-changing consumer needs."<ref name=gillespie>{{cite news |last=Gillespie |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick Gillespie |title=The Great Gatsby's Creative Destruction |publisher=Reason |date=2 May 2013 |url=http://reason.com/archives/2013/05/02/the-great-gatsbys-creative-destruction/print |accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref> This interpretation asserts that ''The Great Gatsby'' captures the American experience because it is a story about change and those who resist it; whether the change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants (Southern Europeans in the early 20th century, Latin Americans today), the [[nouveau riche]], or successful minorities, Americans from the 1920s to modern day have plenty of experience with changing economic and social circumstances. As Gillespie states, "While the specific terms of the equation are always changing, it's easy to see echoes of ''Gatsby'''s basic conflict between established sources of economic and cultural power and upstarts in virtually all aspects of American society."<ref name=gillespie/> Because this concept is particularly American and can be seen throughout American history, readers are able to relate to ''The Great Gatsby'' (which has lent the novel an enduring popularity).<ref name=gillespie/>

Later critical writings on of The Great Gatsby following the novel's revival focus in particular on Fitzgerald's disillusionment with the American Dream&nbsp;— life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&nbsp;– in the context of the hedonistic Jazz Age, a name for the era which Fitzgerald claimed to have coined. In 1970, Roger Pearson published the article Gatsby: False prophet of the American Dream, in which he states that Fitzgerald "has come to be associated with this concept of the AMERICAN Dream more than any other writer of the twentieth century".<ref>Pearson, Roger L. "Gatsby: False Prophet of the American Dream." The English Journal 59.5 (1970): n. pag. JSTOR. Web. 12 Apr. 2015.</ref> Pearson goes on to suggest that Gatsby's failure to realize the American dream demonstrates that it no longer exists except in the minds of those as materialistic as Gatsby. He concludes that the American dream pursued by Gatsby "is, in reality, a nightmare", bringing nothing but discontent and disillusionment to those who chase it as they realize its unsustainability and ultimately its unattainability.

In addition to exploring the trials and tribulations of achieving the great American dream during the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby explores societal gender expectations as a theme, exemplifying in Daisy Buchanan's character the marginalization of women in the East Egg social class that Fitzgerald depicts. As an upper-class, white woman living in East Egg during this time period in America, Daisy must adhere to certain societal expectations, including but certainly not limited to actively filling the role of dutiful wife, mother, keeper of the house, and charming socialite. As the reader finds in the novel, many of Daisy's choices, ultimately culminating in the tragedy of the plot and misery for all those involved, can be at least partly attributed to her prescribed role as a "beautiful little fool" who is completely reliant on her husband for financial and societal security. For instance, one could argue that Daisy's ultimate decision to remain with her husband despite her feelings for Gatsby can be attributed to the status, security, and comfort that her marriage to Tom Buchanan provides. Additionally, the theme of the female familial role within The Great Gatsby goes hand in hand with that of the ideal family unit associated with the great American dream- a dream that goes unrealized for Gatsby and Daisy in Fitzgerald's prose.<ref>Leland, Person S.

==Reception==
''The Great Gatsby'' was published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald called Perkins on the day of publication to monitor reviews: "Any news?"<ref name=nyt35/> "Sales situation doubtful," read a wire from Perkins on April 20, "[but] excellent reviews." Fitzgerald responded on April 24, saying the cable "depressed" him, closing the letter with "Yours in great depression."<ref name=lc/> Fitzgerald had hoped the novel would be a great commercial success, perhaps selling as many as 75,000 copies.<ref name=lc>{{cite book |last=O'Meara |first=Lauraleigh |title=Lost City: Fitzgerald's New York |year=2002 |edition=1st paperback |isbn=978-0-415-86701-6 |publisher=Routledge |url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415940559/ |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> By October, when the original sale had run its course, the book had sold fewer than 20,000 copies.<ref name=nyt35/><ref name=boston>{{cite news |title='Gatsby': What's so great? |last=Symkus |first=Ed |url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2013/05/04/gatsby-what-great/jiqRfty6ySLbZUXpXWf3sL/story.html |work=Boston Globe |date=4 May 2013 |accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=lc/> Despite this, Scribner's continually kept the book in print; they carried the original edition on their trade list until 1946, by which time ''Gatsby'' was in print in three other forms and the original edition was no longer needed.<ref name=nyt35/> Fitzgerald received letters of praise from contemporaries [[T. S.

''The Great Gatsby'' received mixed reviews from literary critics of the day.

Several writers felt that the novel left much to be desired following Fitzgerald's previous works and promptly criticized him. Harvey Eagleton of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' believed the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald's success: "One finishes ''Great Gatsby'' with a feeling of regret, not for the fate of the people in the book, but for Mr. Fitzgerald."<ref name=dmnreview>{{cite news |last=Eagleton |first=Harvey |title=Profits of the New Age III.

Fitzgerald's goal was to produce a literary work which would truly prove himself as a writer,<ref name="Mizener 1951 167">{{Harvnb|Mizener|1951|p=167}}</ref> and ''Gatsby'' did not have the commercial success of his two previous novels, ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' and ''[[The Beautiful and Damned]]''. Although the novel went through two initial printings, some of these copies remained unsold years later.<ref name="Bruccoli 2000 175">{{Harvnb|Bruccoli|2000|p=175}}</ref> Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time, and ''Gatsby'' did not contain an admirable female character.<ref name="Bruccoli 2000 175"/> According to his own ledger, now made available online by [[University of South Carolina]]'s Thomas Cooper library, he earned only $2,000 from the book.<ref>{{cite news |last=Howell |first=Peter |title=Five things you didn't know about The Great Gatsby |url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2013/05/05/five_things_you_didnt_know_about_the_great_gatsby.html |work=The Star |date=5 May 2013 |accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> Although 1926 brought Owen Davis's stage adaption and the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]-issued silent film version, both of which brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and, most importantly, would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye.<ref name=nyt35/> For several years afterward, the general public believed ''The Great Gatsby'' to be nothing more than a nostalgic period piece.<ref name=nyt35/>

By 1944, full-length articles on Fitzgerald's works were being published, and the following year, "the opinion that ''Gatsby'' was merely a period piece had almost entirely disappeared."<ref name=nyt35/> This revival was paved by interest shown by literary critic Edmund Wilson, who was Fitzgerald's friend.<ref>{{cite news|title=Careless people of F Scott Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby have a modern equivalent|last=Verghis|first=Sharon|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/careless-people-of-f-scott-fitzgeralds-great-gatsby-have-a-modern-equivalent/story-fn9n8gph-1226633866573|work=The Australian|date=4 May 2013|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> In 1951, [[Arthur Mizener]] published ''[[The Far Side of Paradise]]'', a biography of Fitzgerald.<ref name="Bruccoli 2000 217">{{Harvnb|Bruccoli|2000|p=217}}</ref> He emphasized ''The Great Gatsby''{{'}}s positive reception by literary critics, which may have influenced public opinion and renewed interest in it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mizener|1951|p=183}}</ref>

By 1960, the book was steadily selling 50,000 copies per year, and renewed interest led ''[[The New York Times]]'' editorialist Arthur Mizener to proclaim the novel "a classic of twentieth-century American fiction".<ref name=nyt35/> ''The Great Gatsby'' has sold over 25 million copies worldwide,{{when|date=August 2014}}<ref name=usatodaysales/> annually sells an additional 500,000 copies, and is Scribner's most popular title; in 2013, the [[e-book]] alone sold 185,000 copies.<ref name=usatodaysales/>

In 2013, cultural historian, [[Bob Batchelor]], authored ''[[Gatsby: The Cultural History of the Great American Novel]],'' in which he explored the enduring influence of the book by tracing it "from the book's publication in 1925 through today's headlines filled with celebrity intrigue, corporate greed, and a roller-coaster economy".<ref>{{cite web|website=Amazon.com|url=http://www.amazon.com/Gatsby-Cultural-American-Contemporary-Literature/dp/0810891956|title=Description of ''Gatsby: The Cultural History of the Great American Novel'' }}</ref>
